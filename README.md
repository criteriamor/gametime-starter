## Gameplay

As a player, you will compete against two other players in four rounds of action! Each round provides a new puzzle to solve. Whoever solves the puzzle will have their round score added to their total score. Whoever has the most points at the end of the fourth round will be declared the winner, and get a shot to win the GRAND PRIZE in the bonus round. You must spin at every turn and if you want to buy a vowel it will cost 100 points! If you dont have 100 points, you will not be able to buy vowels.

## Development Process

We created this app using Object Oriented Programming and Test Driven Development. We used Mocha as our testing framework and Chai as our assertion library.
